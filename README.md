Style Guide [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pivotalexperimental/style-guide.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotalexperimental/style-guide) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide.png)](https://gemnasium.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/pivotalexperimental/style-guide)
===

Style Guide is a mountable Rails engine where you curate and view your site's visual elements.

Tutorials on important topics, such as creating your own Style Guide sections, writing documentation for visual elements and more can be found in the [Style Guide wiki](https://github.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide/wiki).


Features
--------

* Simple: just directories of partials
* Responsive: see how everything looks on a mobile device
* Live: file changes are presented immediately when using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com)
* Documentation-aware: each partial can be documented with an i18n scope


Anti-Features
-------------

* Not a Layout Guide: visual elements should not be composed
* Not a linting tool: no warnings or errors are displayed
* Curated, not magic: providing fake data for partials is not covered

Changes in Zephyr's implementation
----------------------------------
* Is a layout guide - sections that contain pages (not partials) which demonstrate composed views = "Components" (not done)
* Supports seperate pipelines - we have a vendor.css and vendor.js, so we can configure these (js not done)

Example
-------

You can see an example of Style Guide at swivel's automatically-deployed
testing instance: [http://swivel.herokuapp.com](http://swivel.herokuapp.com)


Installation
------------

The simplest way to install Style Guide is to use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com).

Add Style Guide to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'style-guide'
end
```

Then, use Bundler to install the gem and its dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Last, run the Rails generator to configure your app:

```bash
$ rails g style_guide:install
```

The generator will install [guard-livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) and [rack-livereload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload).

Consult the [Style Guide wiki](https://github.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide/wiki) for more information about what the generator does.


Contributing
------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important because breaking your feature in a future version unintentionally is sad.
* Issue a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
